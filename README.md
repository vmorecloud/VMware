VMware vCenter 9 (part of vSphere 9.0/VCF 9.0) is a significant update modernizing the platform with features like NVMe memory tiering, enhanced security (Trusted Domains), better container/VM management, unified operations (VCF Operations),
and a new licensing model where vCenter licensing shifts under the VCF/VVF umbrella. Key benefits include cost reduction (up to 40% with NVMe), faster updates, streamlined operations, and support for next-gen applications, creating a cloud-like
experience on-premises.
